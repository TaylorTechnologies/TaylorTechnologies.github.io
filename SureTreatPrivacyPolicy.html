<p>This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is between you, a business owner and/or an employee of an Authorized Zodiac Dealer, and Taylor Technologies, Inc., on behalf of itself, and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Taylor Technologies", "we", or "us"), and describes Taylor Technologies' treatment of information, including personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Taylor Technologies collects from you when you are accessing and/or using Taylor Technologies' websites, software and mobile applications, including the Zodiac website: <a href="//www.zodiacpuresolutions.com" target="_blank">www.zodiacpuresolutions.com</a> (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as, the "Site") and all data and content that is accessed, utilized, input, or generated by the Site. By accessing and/or using the Site, you agree that information you have provided, or provide in the future, including but not limited to Personal Information and the Personal Information of your customers, may be used and disclosed as described below.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">What Types of Personal Information Does Taylor Technologies Gather?</div>

<p class="first">In general, you may visit the Site without telling Taylor Technologies who you are or revealing personal information about yourself (however, you are required to create an account to access the www.suretreat.com features). The information Taylor Technologies collects without your specific consent is anonymous and cannot identify you. For example, Taylor Technologies, its business partners and other companies providing services to or on behalf of Taylor Technologies (such as, for example, companies assisting with the operation or features of the Site, and the like) may use various technologies (such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, click-through URL links) to collect non-personally identifiable information discernible as a result of your visit. This may include, without limitation, your IP address, web pages requested or viewed, date, time and domain type, demographic information and responses to surveys, promotions and advertisements. Information gleaned from your browser is automatically received and recorded on server logs. As technology evolves, information may be gathered through other means as well. You may set your browser either to notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. However, if you do so you may not be able to participate in certain parts of Site and/or its features.</p>

<p>Personal information is information collected from a variety of sources in any form that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number in conjunction with additional information that may not be otherwise publicly available, such as professional, employment, or other demographic data. You may provide personally identifiable information directly; it may be gleaned through the Site or collected from other sources. For example, when you create a User account and choose a password for security, you are required to provide personal information. The Site saves your information so that the next time you access your account, you only need to enter your unique ID and password. You cannot communicate with Taylor Technologies without providing personally identifiable information. If you contact Taylor Technologies or its third party providers, a record of that session or correspondence will be maintained. Your contact information is collected and stored when you access the Site, or request information.</p>

<p>We collect information from you when you use the Site, when you request information, or create or use a Zodiac Pure Solutions account. We may also automatically collect information regarding your interaction with, and use of, the Site. We may use a variety of methods to collect this information, including, but not limited to, cookies, pixel tags, Web beacons, embedded Web links and other commonly used information gathering tools ("Automatic Data Collection Tools"). These Automatic Data Collection Tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to us such as your browser type and language, access times, IP address, user-agent string and click stream behavior. We may also use Google Analytics or similar programs for internal tracking purposes. Information may be collected by us, by (~mcZodiacCorporateName~)<!---2.1.1.6 Zodiac Group Australia Pty Ltd-->, the "Commercial Provider", or by our vendors who provide internet hosting for the Site. We may combine information you give us with other information from Taylor Technologies sources, transactions and communications. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data from third parties.</p>

<p>All information that you input when accessing and/or using the Site is subject to collection and storage by Taylor Technologies. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, company name, your job title, email and physical address, and telephone number.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">Account Information</div>

<p class="first">You are responsible for the safety and security of all user IDs, logins, passwords or other security features through which you access the Site, the Services and for all communications made through the Site. You may not disclose your ID, login, passwords or security features to anyone else in order to preserve the confidentiality of your account and other personal information and not share or otherwise disclose your user IDs and passwords outside your Authorized Zodiac Dealer entity.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">How Does Taylor Technologies Use Personal Information It Receives From Me?</div>

<p class="first">Taylor Technologies uses personal information you provide in a number of ways. When you register, you create a profile that enables you to choose to interact with Taylor Technologies or the Commercial Provider in a variety of ways, including, receiving emails and other notifications from various technologies. You may, at any time, terminate your interactions through the Site by providing notice in accordance with the Terms of Use. Please note that you may continue to receive messages for a short time until Taylor Technologies' records are updated. Information collected from any source may be combined to improve the Site and Services and enable more targeted, tailored communications. It may also be aggregated and made available without identifying you to ascertain trends, products, security/privacy patterns and research, internal record keeping and reporting, measuring and reporting learning, performance and other statistical information concerning any aspect of the Site.</p>

<p>Taylor Technologies uses information collected to administer the Site, provide the Services, and assist in diagnosing problems, all of which assists Taylor Technologies in better understanding how visitors use the Site. We may use your information to communicate with you regarding our products and services, if applicable, your account information or other customer service matters; to respond to your questions and instructions; and to enhance, customize, and personalize your experiences and communications with us. Taylor Technologies may use any non-personal information gained through or gleaned from the Site for any legal purpose, including to develop, use and make available to third parties (at no charge or for a fee) aggregated information, such as regarding trends, services, security/privacy patterns and research, internal record keeping and reporting, measuring and reporting learning, performance and other statistical information concerning any aspect of the Site. If you do provide Taylor Technologies with your personally identifiable information or that of your customers, Taylor Technologies will use it only for the purpose for which it is collected in compliance with this Privacy Policy, unless you consent to a broader use.</p>

<p>We may use your information to operate, provide, improve and maintain our products and services, including analyzing user behavior and trends; to send you administrative messages and other information about Taylor Technologies and its product offerings; to investigate or take action regarding violations or suspected violations of law or our terms; and to maintain the integrity of our network and address security issues.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">With Whom Does Taylor Technologies Share The Personal Information It Receives?</div>

<p class="first">We are not in the business of selling your Personal Information or the Personal information of your customers to others. We share customer information only as described below.</p>

<p>We may provide your and your customer information to our current or future subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Taylor Technologies Companies"). Unless not permitted by applicable law, all companies within the Taylor Technologies Companies share information collected through the Site and may contact you directly. We employ other companies (including our affiliates) and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Taylor Technologies works with support companies who assist with the administration of the Site, including, but not limited to, hosting the Site on their servers, and assisting with your questions and technical issues. Our service companies are contractually required to use any data they can access only for the above purposes and to never disclose these data to third parties. In addition, your personal information and that of your customers is accessible to the Commercial Provider in connection with your use of your Zodiac Pure Solutions account.</p>

<p>We release Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply Privacy Policy and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Policy. Taylor Technologies may also disclose or access account information when it believes, in good faith, that disclosure is required by law, or for administrative and other purposes deemed necessary to protect its rights or property.</p>

<p>If we were to otherwise cease operations, or if our company is acquired by or merged with or into another entity, or if our assets or business is sold or transferred to another entity, your personal information may be transferred to such entity as part of the transaction, and that entity and its affiliates may use your personal information or that of your customers under the terms of their own privacy policies which may differ from this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Other than as described above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. We will not share your personal information for this purpose without your prior consent.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">Data Retention and Opt-Out</div>

<p class="first">We may collect and store your data for as long as you continue to access the Site and/or use the Services. Please note that after you cease to access the Site, your data is not automatically deleted and will continue to exist, with all information associated with your account being subject to use, sharing, and retention as stated in this Privacy Policy.  Pursuant to the Terms of Use, you can request Taylor Technologies to destroy Customer Identifiable Information upon termination.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">Information Security</div>

<p class="first">Information security is important to Taylor Technologies. We have established appropriate physical, electronic and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect from you or about you or your customers. These safeguards are regularly reviewed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure and improper use of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data. We use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication tools, to help protect your information. However, like other companies, Taylor Technologies cannot guarantee 100% the security or confidentiality of the information you provide to us. Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard your Personal Information or that of your customers against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not warrant or guarantee the absolute security of any Personal Information you transmit to, from or through the Site. In the event that we become aware of a security breach involving your Personal Information stored by or for us, we may notify you by posting such information to the Site or via email, to the extent available in connection with the Services.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">Third Party Privacy Policies</div>

<p class="first">Once you leave this Site, whether independently or via links from the Site, the privacy policies of the website to which you migrate will apply. This Privacy Policy applies to your interactions with this Site only.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">International Users; State Restrictions</div>

Regardless of where you live, you consent to have your Personal Information and that of your customers transferred, processed and stored in the United States, and allow Taylor Technologies to use and collect your personal information and that of your customers in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please note that the Site is not intended for use by a person in any state or country where such use would be contrary to local laws or regulations.</p>

<p><p><span class="italic">International Users:</span> If you access the Site outside the United States, your connection may be through and to servers located in your country or the United States. Any Personal Information you provide may be processed and maintained in the United States on servers and/or other network systems operated by or for Taylor Technologies' benefit. IF THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED OR YOUR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN HAS LAWS OR REGULATIONS WHICH REQUIRE THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BE RECEIVED, USED, SAVED, TRANSFERRED AND/OR OTHERWISE HANDLED IN A MANNER DIFFERENT THAN AS STATED IN THESE THIS PRIVACY POLICY, THEN YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO UTILIZE THE SERVICES. If you access the Site from and/or reside outside of the United States, your information may be stored, transmitted and shared in accordance with U.S. data privacy laws which may not be equivalent to those in effect in your country. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT USE THE SITE WITH ANY EXPECTATION OF GREATER PRIVACY RIGHTS THAN THOSE TO WHICH YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AGREED AS STATED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">Changes</div>

<p class="first">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time without prior notice. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will become effective upon posting of the updated Privacy Policy on the Site. We encourage you to bookmark our Internet sites and to periodically review them to ensure familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy. We may ask you to affirmatively acknowledge consent to any changes to this Policy (e.g., by checking a box or clicking a button) at the time of your next interaction with the Site that requires provision of Personal Information as a condition of continuing use of the Site.</p>

<div class="sectionheading">Governing Law</div>

<p class="first">The Site and this Privacy Policy are governed by the laws of the State of Maryland and all disputes shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts serving Baltimore County, Maryland. The parties agree to waive all right to a jury trial in connection with disputes arising under this Privacy Policy. In no event shall Taylor Technologies ever be liable to you for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages and Taylor Technologies' maximum liability to you in connection with this Privacy Policy shall be $100.
